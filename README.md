# SumUp Golang Lessons

Welcome to the docs for the Golang lessons hosted at SumUp. Here you will find all the relevant information that we've covered during the sessions.

We have two learning tracks - Beginners and Advanced.

The Beginners track is intended for people without computer science background. We start slowly and gentle with the basics of programming. If you have no programming experience, this is a right track for you.

The Advanced track is intended for people who want to switch from another programming language to Go or want to dive deeper into Golang.

Sessions are conducted online every other **Wednesday** from **4:00pm to 5:00pm** online:

- Beginners Track: [Zoom link](https://sumup.zoom.us/j/98019958476)
- Advanced Track: [Zoom link](https://sumup.zoom.us/j/93881003779)

## Learning Materials

Lessons for the Beginners track can be found [here](https://github.com/sumup-go/lessons/tree/main/advanced).

## Setup

We need to install the following on your laptop:
* Go Compiler
* IDE. You can use VSCode or Goland of your choice. Note, Golan**g** is a programming language and Golan**d** is IDE (Integrated Development Environment). VSCode is another IDE. You can use either of them.

Installation.

1. Download and install IDE: [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/download/#section=mac) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Download and install the [Go Compiler](https://go.dev/doc/install)
